        The purpose of homework assignments is to get you thinking about the topics being covered in lecture and in readings in the textbook that are not represented in the hands-on, programming lab assignments.
        The homework also provides you with practice problems in preparation for the exams.
        It is worth noting that the book contains many practice problems similar to the problems we ask on these written assignments!
        The solutions for those practice problems are located at the end of each chapter and can be used as an additional resource as you work on these assignments.

        <p>All homework this quarter is being presented as "quizzes" on Canvas.
        Please follow the links below to find the questions and to input your answers.
        Unfortunately, Canvas is an imperfect system and you must submit <em>the entirety</em> of a quiz at once and can't save intermediate progress.
        You will receive a score immediately after submission, including an indication of which questions you answered incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p style="color:red;">You have <b>20 attempts</b> for each Canvas quiz.
        No late homework will be accepted.
        </p>
        <p>You are encouraged to work in groups and ask questions about the homework on Piazza, <em>but it is in your best interest</em> to attempt the homework by yourself first.
        If you don't fully understand the solutions, it will likely come back to haunt you on the exams, which are worth a much larger percentage of your course grade.
        </p>
        <p style="color:red;">Homework 1 does not use the textbook (CSPP), but future assignments will.</p>
