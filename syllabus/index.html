                <h3>Course Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    We live in a world that is increasingly driven by decisions based on analysis
                    and inference on diverse data sets.
                    This course will give you an introduction to the conceptual knowledge and
                    practical training for doing data science in this environment.
                </p>

                <p>Broadly we will cover these topics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Types of data</li>
                    <li>Evaluating data sets</li>
                    <li>Simulation</li>
                    <li>Probability</li>
                    <li>Hypothesis Testing</li>
                    <li>Estimation</li>
                    <li>Linear regression</li>
                    <li>Basic classification</li>
                </ul>

            <section id="course-content">
                <h3>Course Content</h3>
                <p>
                    The course uses an experimental application called
                    <a href="http://skillitupdev.ischool.uw.edu:4000/#/login">SkillItUp</a>
                    that runs in your browser. The software provides all the learning materials you
                    need and all the evaluations you will receive for the course. The skills section
                    of the application provides links to resource Web pages and practice questions
                    that you can use to learn the course content. The challenges section of the
                    application provides the evaluations you will take. The activities section shows
                    what you will do in class each day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Class content is self-paced but you are expected to complete the full set of
                    assignments by the end of the quarter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Large class time will consist of activities that you participate in and lab
                    sections will give you time to take the evaluations. Project evaluations are
                    “take-home” and can be submitted at any time. You must get full credit for each
                    evaluation but can take an evaluation as many time as you need to.

            <section id="grading">
                <h3>Grading</h3>
                <p>
                    Grades will be based both on percentage of challenge assignments completed in
                    Skill it Up, and on class participation. The class participation score is
                    determined both by attendance and filling out the in-class activities, with an
                    extra score component for leading discussion and contributing to group work.

                <h3>Attendance</h3>
                <p>
                    Course attendance is implicit in participating in the in-class activities, for
                    which participation credit is assigned. While it's not always possible to make
                    every class, extra scores achieved for leading discussion can more than make up
                    for missing a few activities, so it's important to attend class every day.

            <section id="misconduct">
                <h3>Academic Misconduct</h3>
                <p>
                    All work turned in is expected to be your own. Although students are encouraged
                    to study together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution
                    to the challenges. Copying or using sections of someone else's program, even if
                    it has been modified by you, is not acceptable and will result in us referring
                    the situation to the university. Similarly, participation credit codes such as
                    Bumps are for the recipient to enter only, and if used by another student will
                    result in the same academic consequences.
